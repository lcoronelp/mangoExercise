## requirements

### Development
- node
- npm
- yarn

### Production
- docker
- docker-compose

## Building and running

### Install dependencies:

```sh
yarn install
```

### Run in development mode:

#### Without install
```sh
make dev
```

#### Including install
```sh
make installAndDev
```

After this, you can use this links to show the tests
- [Exercise1](https://localhost:8080/exercise1)
- [Exercise2](https://localhost:8080/exercise2)

Additionally, you can use any [mocky.io](https://designer.mocky.io/) mockup with this URL:

https://localhost:8080/exerciseGeneric/{mockCode}

Changing the `{mockCode}` with the uuid generated by mocky.io

For example:

https://localhost:8080/exerciseGeneric/6a25e34a-a46a-4812-9dbb-485228a2b5d7

### Run all tests:

```sh
make test
```

### To create a production build:

```sh
yarn run build-prod
```
### To initiate the production in a docker:

```sh
make prod
```
After this, you can use this links to show the tests
- [Exercise1](http://localhost:1337/exercise1)
- [Exercise2](http://localhost:1337/exercise2)

Additionally, you can use any [mocky.io](https://designer.mocky.io/) mockup with this URL:

[https://localhost:8080/exerciseGeneric/{mockCode}](https://localhost:1337/{mockCode})

Changing the `{mockCode}` with the uuid generated by mocky.io

For example:

https://localhost:1337/exerciseGeneric/6a25e34a-a46a-4812-9dbb-485228a2b5d7


## Implementation documentation

The component `<Range />` have one configurable attribute called `initialData` that is a React object with these properties:

| Property           | Required | Type       | Default Value | Description                                                                                       |
|--------------------|----------|------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `rangeItems`       | `true`   | `number[]` | `null`        | The array with the items to show in the range, can be in order or not (the component reorder it)  |
| `decimalPositions` | `false`  | `int`      | `2`           | Quantity of maximum decimals to show                                                              |
| `currency`         | `false`  | `string`   | `"â‚¬"`         | Currency to show                                                                                  |
| `currencyOnLeft`   | `false`  | `boolean`  | `false`       | Define if currency is on left (true) or right (false), also modifies the text alignment of inputs |
| `locale`           | `false`  | `string`   | `"en"`        | (Not implemented yet) Define the locale of inputs                                                 |

## Notes
- Additionally, to the requested functionality, if the user cross with handlers the another handler, then start to move the other, this behaviour avoids the problem with same position handlers
- The component have a small approach to satisfy the AA WCAG but not work all by keyboard (we can add keydown when handler is focused to allow movements with left/right arrows for example)
- The component respect the user preference of color theme (have light and dark theme)
- At the lateral inputs, probably we need do more work with the carets (specially when the introduced data isn't valid)
- The solution of solve cross selection maybe need to change to block (this is business decision)
- When the user introduce invalid data in the inputs, probably we can show the error somehow, for example a toast or a message below the input
- The production docker is only an example, in reality will be https and can use docker swarm replicas
- The tests were made with jest and testing-library, additionally, we can test directly all helpers functions and test with cypress or puppeteer directly in real browser (or multiple browser compatibility)
- To improve the UX, we can add labels to fixed positions below the bar, but in responsive, we will be found a solution with overlap of labels (hiding the odds progressively except the first and last for example)
